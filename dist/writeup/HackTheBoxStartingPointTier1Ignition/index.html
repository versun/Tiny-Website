<p>Ignition Writeup
Prepared by: One-nine9, ilinor
Introduction
Networking knowledge plays a tremendous part for your overall readiness as an upcoming cybersecurity
engineer. Features such as Active Directory, Kerberos Authentication, Server Message Block, Hypertext
Transfer Protocol, Secure Shell can all be dissected into their (almost) simplest form if enough networking
knowledge is applied. However broad, we will be exploring only a part of the whole networking subject,
specifically HTTP, VHosts and DNS, with this target.
Before you get started with this target, we strongly recommend you brush up on your Networking
knowledge by reading our Introduction to Networking on HTB Academy!
Introduction
to Networking
At the beginning of your journey through networking, you might find yourself understanding connections
between your host and a server at a very general, macro level. The packet simply travels from your end to
the server and then back with a response, right? For the purpose of better grasping the networking
concepts explained by this machine, the write-up will contain a series of diagrams which will evolve
alongside your understanding of references to networking technologies in use today. Let’s start with a web
request example: the simple action of accessing a website through your web browser.
Request…
Host
Server
“Response”
You will see that the more we analyse the current example, the more additional technologies will be added
on top of the current scheme, creating a complex view of the framework the Internet, as a whole entity,
currently relies on for communication between hosts.
Enumeration
Starting off with an nmap scan, we select the -sc and -sv switches to trigger default script scanning and
version detection. This yields us a singular result, port 80 open and running nginx 1.14.2. So far, this seems
straight forward. However, from the output right below that, we notice that http-title returns Did not
follow redirect to <a href="http://ignition">http://ignition</a>. htb. Keep this URL in mind for now.
$ sudo nmap -sC -sV {target_IP}
Starting Nmap 7.91 ( <a href="https://nmap">https://nmap</a>. org ) at 2021-07-09 16:36 CEST

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at <a href="https://nmap.org/submit/">https://nmap.org/submit/</a>.
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 12.15 seconds
Upon attempting to access the webpage through a browser window, we are presented with the following
error. The Check if there is a typo in ignition.htb references the same URL we found during our
nmap scan, but without further details as to what might cause this error to pop up when simply attempting
to access the website. Below, a more detailed error code is displayed: DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN
This site can’t be reached
Check if there is a typo in ignition.htb.
DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN
Reload
After a quick Google search of the error, we learn that there might be two underlying reasons to this error
appearing.
. We’ve mistyped the ignition. htb address in our URL search bar, and the DNS servers can’t find the
associated IP address for the mistyped name.
We never entered any hostname such as ignition. htb into the search bar, but the website expects
us to.
Since we know for a fact that we never entered any hostname into the search bar, we will be exploring the
second option only. This option refers to an issue with what is known as name-based VHosting (or Virtual
Hosting). According to the Wikipedia article on Virtual Hosting, we have the following statements.
Virtual hosting is a method for hosting multiple domain names (with separate handling
of each name) on a single server (or pool of servers) . [1] This allows one server to
share its resources, such as memory and processor cycles, without requiring all
services provided to use the same host name. The term virtual hosting is usually used
in reference to web servers but the principles do carry over to other Internet
services.
[ . . ]
A technical prerequisite needed for name-based virtual hosts is a web browser with
HTTP/1.1 support (commonplace today ) to include the target hostname in the request.
This allows a server hosting multiple sites behind one IP address to deliver the
correct site’s content. More specifically it means setting the Host HTTP header, which
is mandatory in HTTP/1.1. [2]
[ . . ]
Furthermore, if the Domain Name System (DNS) is not properly functioning, it is
difficult to access a virtually-hosted website even if the IP address is known. If the
user tries to fall back to using the IP address to contact the system, as in
<a href="http://10.23.45.67/">http://10.23.45.67/</a>, the web browser will send the IP address as the host name. Since
the web server relies on the web browser client telling it what server name (vhost) to
use, the server will respond with a default website often not the site the user
expects.
A workaround in this case is to add the IP address and host name to the client system’s
hosts file. Accessing the server with the domain name should work again. [ . . ]
In short, multiple websites can share the same IP address, allowing users to access them separately by
visiting the specific hostnames of each website instead of the hosting server’s IP address. The webserver we
are making requests to is throwing us an error because we haven’t specified a certain hostname out of the
ones that could be hosted on that same target IP address. From here, we’d think that simply inputting
ignition.htb instead of the target IP address into the search bar would solve our issue, but unfortunately,
this is not the case. When entering a hostname instead of an IP address as the request’s destination, there is
a middleman involved that you might not know about.
The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for
computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network.
It associates various information with domain names assigned to each of the
participating entities. Most prominently, it translates more readily memorized domain
names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer
services and devices with the underlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide,
distributed directory service, the Domain Name System has been an essential component
of the functionality of the Internet since 1985.
Because DNS is involved when translating the hostnames to the one IP address available on the server’s
side, this will prove to be an issue once the target is isolated, such as in our case. In order to solve this, we
can edit our own local hosts file which includes correlations between hostnames and IP addresses to
accomodate for the lack of a DNS server doing it on our behalf.
Until then, we must first confirm that we are correct. In order to get a better view of the exact requests and
responses being made and to confirm our suspicion, we will need to make use of a popular and easy to use
tool called CURL . This tool will allow us to manipulate HTTP requests made to a server and receive the
responses directly in the terminal, without the latter being interpreted by our browser as generic error
messages such as in the example above.
CURL is pre-installed with almost every Linux operating system. To see its’ capabilities, type curl -h in
your terminal.
…
$ curl -h
Usage: curl [options… ] <url>
-d, —data <data>
HTTP POST data</data></url></p>

This is not the full help, this menu is stripped into categories.
Use “—help category” to get an overview of all categories.
For all options use the manual or “—help all”.
Looking through the help menu options, we decide to simply make the output more detailed, in order to
learn as much as possible from the target’s responses. We can achieve this by increasing the verbosity of
the script’s output.
-v : Make the operation more talkative. More detailed output will be displayed during
runtime.

As observed from the screenshot above, our request contains a Host field which is home to the target’s IP
address instead of the hostname. The 302 Found response, together with the Location header, indicates
that the resource we requested (/ ) has been (temporarily) moved to <a href="http://ignition.htb/">http://ignition.htb/</a> . This means
that our assumptions were true.
To solve the issue we are currently facing here, we will modify our local DNS file named hosts located in
the /etc directory. The first command illustrated below has the purpose of inputting the target’s IP
address with its’ associated hostname in the hosts table, which would in turn allow your web client to visit
the website which was previously reporting an error. Make sure to replace the {target_IP) part on the
first line with the actual IP address for your own target instance, and the {your_password) part on the
second line with your VM’s user account password, since this action requires superuser privileges.
The second command has the role of verifying your previous input. Reading the /etc/hosts file of your
Linux system should return an entry for ignition. htb with the associated target IP address.
$ echo “{target_IP} ignition. htb” | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
[sudo] password for {username): {your_password}
{target_IP} ignition.htb
$ cat /etc/hosts</name></name></user></file></file></category></p>

Once this configuration is complete, we can proceed to reload the target’s webpage and verify if it loads
successfully. Since the requested hostname now has an association in your hosts file, the website can load
without issue. From here, we can start working towards gaining a foothold.

After exploring the landing page for a short period of time, we can deduce that nothing helpful can be
leveraged here. The only option of exploring the website further is using gobuster.

A login screen is presented to us, with a logo for Magento boasting in the middle of the page. A username
and password are being requested. Normally, we would go off credentials we extracted through other
means, such as an FTP server left unsecured, as seen before. This time, however, we will attempt some
default credentials for the Magento service, since there is no other basis upon which we can rely.
The Magento Admin is protected by multiple layers of security measures to prevent
unauthorized access to your store, order, and customer data. The first time you sign in
to the Admin, you are required to enter your username and password and to set up two-
factor authentication (2FA) .
Depending on the configuration of your store, you might also be required to resolve a
CAPTCHA challenge such as entering a series of keyboard characters, solving a puzzle,
or clicking a series of images with a common theme. These tests are designed to
identify you has human, rather than an automated bot.
For additional security, you can determine which parts of the Admin each user has
permission to access, and also limit the number of login attempts. By default, after
six attempts the account is locked, and the user must wait a few minutes before trying
again. Locked accounts can also be reset from the Admin.
An Admin password must be seven or more characters long and include both letters and
numbers .
According to the documentation, we should not attempt to brute force this login form because it has anti-
bruteforce measures implemented, we will need to guess the password. Since the password must be seven
or more characters long &#x26; to include both letters and numbers, we can attempt to use the most common
passwords of the year 2021 as well as a common username, such as admin . From the list, only the following
password fulfils the requirements.
admin admin123
admin root123
admin passwordl
admin administratorl
admin changemel
admin password123
admin qwerty123
admin administrator123
admin changeme123
After manually attempting a number of these credentials, we land on a successful login. The correct
combination is: admin: qwerty123 . We are presented with the Magento administrative panel, where the
flag can be found under the Advanced Reporting section of the Dashboard.
One or more Indexers are Invalid. Make sure your Magento cron job is running.
