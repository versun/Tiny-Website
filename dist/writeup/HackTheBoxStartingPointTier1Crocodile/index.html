Prepared by: One-nine9, ilinor
Introduction
Tier I is all about exploitation vectors that chain together to offer you the possibility of gaining a foothold on
the target from one service to another. Credentials could be lost somewhere in a publicly accessible folder
which would let you login through a remote shell left untended and unmonitored. A misconfigured service
could be leaking information that might allow you to impersonate the digital identity of a victim. Any
number of possibilities exist in the real world. However, we will start with some simpler ones.
Tackling an example sewed together from two other previous targets, we will be looking at an insecure
access configuration on FTP and an administrative login for a website. Let us proceed to deconstruct this
vector and analyze its’ components.
Enumeration
We will start by enumeratiog the target. Our first step is, as always, a thorough nmap scan. By using the
following two switches for the scan, we ensure that our nmap script analyses the service being run on any
port found in the open state and returns a mostly exact service version value in the output and that all of
the default analysis scripts are run against the target, as we are not constrained on how intrusive we can be
with our scan. Running the scan as mentioned, we can receive results as seen below, with snippets of
directories the scan has even found for us!
-SC: Performs a script scan using the default set of scripts. It is equivalent to —
script=default. Some of the scripts in this category are considered intrusive and
should not be run against a target network without permission.
-SV: Enables version detection, which will detect what versions are running on what
port.
…

We have two open ports: 21 and 80. Port 21 is the port dedicated to FTP (File Transfer Protocol), meaning
that its’ primary use is to transfer files between hosts on the same network.
According to Wikipedia, a quick reminder:
The File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard communication protocol used to transfer
computer files from a server to a client on a computer network. FTP users may
authenticate themselves with a clear-text sign-in protocol, generally using a username
and password. However, they can connect anonymously if the server is configured to
allow it.
Users could connect to the FTP server anonymously if the server is configured to allow it, meaning that we
could use it even if we had no valid credentials. If we look back at our nmap scan result, the FTP server is
indeed configured to allow anonymous login:
ftp-anon: Anonymous FTP login allowed (FTP code 230)
If you need a refresher, the ftp -h command will help you figure out the available commands for the FTP
service on your local host.
…
$ ftp -h
Usage: { ftp | pftp ) [-46pinegvtd] [hostname]
-4: use IPV4 addresses only
-6: use IPV6, nothing else
-p: enable passive mode (default for pftp)
-i: turn off prompting during mget
-n: inhibit auto-login
-e: disable readline support, if present
-g: disable filename globbing
-v: verbose mode
-t: enable packet tracing [nonfunctional]
-d: enable debugging
To connect to the remote FTP server, you need to specify the target’s IP address (or hostname), as displayed
on the Starting Point lab page. The prompt will then ask us for our login credentials, which is where we can
fill in the anonymous username. In our case, the FTP server does not request a password, and inputting the
anonymous username proves enough for us to receive the 230 code, Login successful .
$ ftp {target_IP}
Connected to {target_IP}.
220 ( vsFTPd 3.0.3)
Name ({target_IP} : {username} ) : anonymous
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.

We will use dir and get to list the directories and manipulate the files stored on the FTP server. With the
dir command, we can check the contents of our current directory on the remote host, where two
interesting files catch out attention. They seem to be files left over from the configuration of another service
on the host, most likely the HTTPD Web Server. Their names are descriptive, hinting towards a possible
username list and associated passwords.

226 Directory send OK.
Both files can easily be downloaded using the get command. The FTP service will report the download
status completion back to you during this phase. It should not take long to have them both sitting snuggly
on your attacking VM.

150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for allowed . userlist. passwd (62 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
62 bytes received in 0.00 secs (126.6671 kB/s)
Termination of the FTP connection can be done by using the exit command. This will return the current
terminal tab to its’ previous state.
ftp> exit
221 Goodbye.
Immediately after exiting the FTP service shell, we can type in the Is command to check if our files are
present in the directory we were last positioned in. In order to read their contents and discover and
usernames and passwords within, we can use the cat command, followed by the name of the file we want
to open.
$ cat allowed . userlist

admin
$ cat allowed . userlist . passwd
root

Foothold
After the credentials have been obtained, the next step is to check if they are used on the FTP service for
elevated access or the webserver running on port 80 discovered during the nmap scan. Attempting to log in
with any of the credentials on the FTP server returns error code 530 This FTP server is anonymous
only . No luck here, so we can exit the FTP service shell.
.. .
$ ftp {target_IP}
Connected to {target_IP}.
220 (vSFTPd 3.0.3)
Name ( {target_IP}: {username} ) : aron
530 This FTP server is anonymous only.
Login failed.
ftp> exit
221 Goodbye.
However, we have one option left. During the nmap scan, the service running on port 80 was reported as
Apache httpd 2.4.41 , an Apache HTTP server. Typing in the IP address of the target into our browser’s
URL search bar results in this webpage. It seems to be a storefront for a server hosting company.

Reading about the target is helpful, but only at a surface level. In order to gain more insight into the
technology they have used to create their website and possibly find any associated vulnerabilities, we can
use a handy browser plug-in called Wappalyzer. This plug-in analyzes the web page’s code and returns all
the different technologies used to build it, such as the webserver type, JavaScript libraries, programming
languages, and more. You can press the links below to add the plug-in to your browser of choice.

From the output of Wappalyzer, we can note some of the more interesting items, specifically the PHP
programming language used to build the web page. However, nothing gives us a direct plan of attack for
now. Meanwhile, navigating around the page using the tabs and buttons provided on it leads us nowhere.
Referencing previous write-ups, there is mention of a different, more direct way of navigating any hidden or
hardly accessible directories and pages, and that is through dir busting. Using gobuster as our tool of
choice, we can use the following switches for the script to get the fastest, most accurate results.
dir : Uses directory/file enumeration mode.
—url : The target URL.
—wordlist : Path to the wordlist.
-x : File extension(s) to search for.
For the -x switch, we can specify php and html to filter out all the unnecessary clutter that does not
interest us. PHP and HTML files will most commonly be pages. We might get lucky and find an
administrative panel login page that could help us find leverage against the target in combination with the
credentials we extracted from the FTP server.

One of the most interesting files gobuster retrieved is the /login. php page. Navigating manually to the
URL, in the form of http://{target_IP}/login. php, we are met with a login page asking for a
username/password combination.

If the lists of credentials we found had been longer, we could have used a Metasploit module or a login
brute-force script to run through combinations from both lists faster than manual labor. In this case,
however, the lists are relatively small, allowing us to attempt logging in manually.

After attempting several username/password combinations, we manage to log in and are met with a Server

causing havoc for the userbase and owners or extract more information that would assist them with gaining
a foothold on the servers hosting the web page.
